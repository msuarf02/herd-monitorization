# Use of CNNs to identify Wildlife Animals

We make use of Convolutional Neural Networks to identify wildlife animals.  

## Basic Steps
`Step 1:` Import Libraries and Load the Dataset (Imagefolder,...,Loaders)<br>
`Step 2:` Create a CNN to Classify Wild Animals (from Scratch)<br>
`Step 3:` Create a CNN to Classify Wild Animals (using Transfer Learning)<br>
`Step 4:` Find Results<br>

## Dataset

In notebook we will be working with the Oregon Wildlife [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/virtualdvid/oregon-wildlife/kernels) created by [David Molina](https://www.kaggle.com/virtualdvid) with a google scrapper.It constains about 14.000 pictures of 19 different wildlife species. 
Count of picture by animal. 

- 660 elk images.
- 696 bobcat images.
- 686 cougar images.
- 748 bald_eagle images.
- 717 canada_lynx images.
- 668 gray_fox images.
- 736 coyote images.
- 735 columbian_black-tailed_deer images.
- 718 black_bear images.
- 764 deer images.
- 577 mountain_beaver images.
- 728 virginia_opossum images.
- 726 sea_lions images.
- 701 nutria images.
- 759 red_fox images.
- 728 raccoon images.
- 656 raven images.
- 698 seals images.
- 730 gray_wolf images.
- 588 ringtail images.

## Results
We achieve a high accuracy of 83% using our CNN and 92% with transfer learning. 

This was a very fun project. Check the result in a image.
